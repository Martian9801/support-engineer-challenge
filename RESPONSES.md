Dear customer 

It seems that there is an issue with the deployment of your app, and it is not running correctly.
 The error message is saying that a health check failed, which means that the app is not responding as expected.

To fix this, you might want to check the logs to find out more information about what is causing the issue. 
It could be related to the app's configuration or the code itself.
You can Refer to Fly.docs 

I hope that makes the error message a bit more understandable. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to help.

Thank You 


in parallel I would check If there is any problem from our side  or customer side using google and community forums  and resources  to confirm and ensure  it's all good at our end, I would call product engineer and operation enginner to affirm and would proceed to guide customer with his problem by navigating him to  use fly.io docs and community forum

I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your app on Fly.io
Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:
1) Check the logs for your app to see if there are any error messages that might explain what's going on. You can access your logs from the Fly.io dashboard.

2) Check the health checks for your app to make sure they're set up correctly. If they're not, they might be causing your app to become unavailable.

3) Double-check your app's configuration to make sure it's set up correctly for the regions you've deployed it to. You might need to adjust your configuration to make it work properly on Fly.io
4)  You can go through fly.docs to troubleshoot your issue 
 
 Additionally, I would like to point out that just because your app is working locally doesn't necessarily mean it will work the same way on Fly.io. There might be differences in the environment or configuration that are causing the issue. So it's always best to test your app on Fly.io before you deploy it to ensure that it's working as expected. 
 
 I hope these steps help you get to the bottom of the issue.
 Let us know how it goes and if you have any further questions
